## Challenges Faced

- **Making the Page Fully Responsive**: One of the main challenges was ensuring that the page was **perfectly responsive** across all device sizes. I had to carefully adjust the layout and test it on various screen sizes to make sure that everything scaled appropriately.
- **Integrating Figma Design Accurately**: Translating the Figma design into code proved to be difficult at times, especially when it came to spacing, font sizes, and overall layout precision. I had to tweak a lot of values to make it match the design as closely as possible.
- **CSS and Bootstrap Conflicts**: There were moments when custom CSS styling conflicted with Bootstrapâ€™s default styles. Finding the balance between Bootstrap's pre-defined classes and custom styles took some time to figure out.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensuring the page functioned correctly across all major browsers was challenging. I had to spend time debugging some styling issues that appeared in specific browsers like Safari and Internet Explorer.


## What I Learned

- **Responsive Web Design**: Through this project, I learned how to make a webpage responsive using **Bootstrap's grid system** and **media queries**. I gained hands-on experience in making sure that elements adjust according to different screen sizes.
- **Bootstrap**: I gained practical knowledge of how to implement Bootstrap components such as **navigation bars**, **cards**, and **buttons**, which made it much faster to design and develop the page.
- **Figma to Code**: Translating a Figma design into a fully functional webpage allowed me to understand how to bridge the gap between a designer's vision and actual web development, which is an essential skill in web development projects.
- **Styling Techniques**: I improved my CSS skills, including layout management with flexbox, custom styling, and typography adjustments.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: I learned how to ensure that my webpage looks and functions well across different browsers by testing and fixing small browser-specific issues.
